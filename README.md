This is a port to Linux & OpenPandora of Stunt Car Racer Remake, a windows remake of the old Stunt Car Racer from the AtariST/Amiga time.

## Building

To build on Linux, simply use `make LINUX=1`
For ODroid it will be `make ODROID=1`
and for PocketCHIP: `make CHIP=1`
a simple `make` will build for Pandora.
Also, you can also use SDL2 instead of SDL1, by adding `SDL=2` to the make command (so SDL2 Linux is `make LINUX=1 SDL=2`)

You can play Emscripten version, built using [gl4es](https://github.com/ptitSeb/gl4es) here: [Web version](http://ptitseb.github.io/stuntcarremake/)

Some code (the OpenAL part) come from Forsaken/ProjectX port by chino.

## Windows-Specific Features 

The Windows build includes additional features not available on Linux:

### Dynamic Window Resizing
- **Resizable window** with automatic aspect ratio preservation (16:10 for widescreen, 4:3 for standard)
- **Dynamic font scaling** - fonts and UI text scale based on window size
- **Dynamic cockpit scaling** - cockpit overlay scales proportionally with window resolution
- **Intelligent positioning** - UI elements maintain proper positioning at any resolution

**Technical Details:**
- Implemented via Win32 `WM_SIZING` message handler
- Uses DirectX backbuffer dimensions for accurate scaling calculations
- Base resolutions: 800x480 (widescreen) or 640x480 (standard)
- All scaling factors calculated dynamically from current vs base resolution

**Linux Status:** Linux builds use fixed resolution (800x480 or 640x480) as the SDL implementation does not currently support dynamic resizing. The scaling code is present but inactive (returns 1.0x scale) to maintain compatibility.
